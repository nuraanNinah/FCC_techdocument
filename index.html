                <p>The Internet is a wonderful place. It is full of really amazing learning resources that are
                    created and maintained by passionate and knowledgeable people. It’s a hell of a job, and we are
                    grateful that someone is doing it.<br>

                    We try to leverage other people’s good work as much as possible. We provide you with the best
                    resources we can find and we supplement those resources with our own projects and explanations
                    where needed.</p><br>
                <p>Learning to code is hard for a bunch of reasons.

                    of the SpecRunner.html.To start using Jasmine, replace the source/spec files with your
                    own. Then Load the SpecRunner.html in your favorite browser </p>
                <br>
                <ul class="lists">
                    <li>knowing what technologies to learn about it hard. Starting with the wrong technology can be
                        enough to turn people off coding completely. Eg, starting with C is probably not the best
                        bet.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>selecting resources to learn from is hard. There is sooo much stuff out there, and a lot of
                        it is bad quality or out of date</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>doing things in a sensible order is hard. Where should you even start</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>staying on track is hard. Things can get frustrating from time to time, especially when you
                        are still getting to grips with things. Having people around who keep an eye on you is a
                        very powerful thing</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>learning to solve real problems is hard. And finding the right problems to practice the
                        skills needed is hard.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>And then when you are skilled up, then proving that you have the skill to do coding work is hard
                    <br>
                    And there are loads of things that you can only really learn through practice. Like how to work
                    effectively in an agile environment, and how to communicate effectively about code, and other
                    “soft skills” (which are also hard, by the way).
                    <br>
                    For that hard stuff, we’ve got you covered :)</p>

                <p>Create a personal website to showcase your talents and ambitions.
                    <br><br>
                    The content and information you choose to display is up to you. There should be some information
                    about your skills, interests, and previous experience, as well as information on how to get in
                    touch with you. Think about the user experience when designing your layout and navigation.
                    <br><br>
                    The HTML and CSS should be developed in a logical way with good naming conventions that would
                    allow another developer to easily understand and build upon your code.
                    <br><br>
                    Your web page files and folders should be organised and named in a logical manner.
                    <br><br>
                    Once you have finished your design and are satisfied with the style and content, upload the

                <header class="docheader">Beginning Bash</header>
                <p>In order to interact properly with Git, you’ll need to know a little bit about “the command
                    line”.
                    <br><br>
                    The first step is to open the command line or terminal on your device:</p><br>
                <ul class="lists">
                    <li>If you are using mac or linux, just open your terminal</li>
                    <li>If you are running Windows, then open your git shell</li>
                    <li>If you are using mac or linux, just open your terminal</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>If this is the first time you’ve ever opened such a program, DONT PANIC! You’ll get used to this
                    thing.<br><br>
                    Now you’ll need to learn a few basic commands to get by</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Later on, if you get into Umuzi, you’ll be expected to know all that stuff. But for the bootcamp,
                    just the basics are ok.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>This ‘bootcamp’ is intended to provide the reader with a basic overview of essential Unix/Linux
                    commands that will allow them to navigate a file system and move, copy, edit files. It will also
                    introduce a brief overview of some ‘power’ commands in Unix. It was orginally developed as part
                    of a Bioinformatics Core Workshop taught at UC Davis (Using the Linux Command-Line for Analysis
                    of High Throughput Sequence Data).</p>

                <header class="docheader">Git Basic Exercises</header>
                <p>This little exercise will take you through the basic git mechanisms you need to know about in
                    order to be productive. By the end of this exercise you’ll be able to create and manage your own
                    git repos.
                    <br><br>
                <p>Skillz you’ll learn:</p><br>
                <ul class="lists">
                    <li>How to set up a repository on Github</li>
                    <li>How to make commits</li>
                    <li>How to make branches and switch between them</li>
                    <li>How to use gitignore files</li>
                    <li>How to merge branches</li>
                    <li>How to overcome merge conflicts</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>When you are finished with these excercises come re-read this section and make sure you know what
                    all these things mean.<br><br></p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Open up a terminal and do the following:</p>
                <br><br>
                <p><b>Your initial commit</b></p>
                <br>

                <p>Create a directory named</p><code>git-basic-exercises</code>
                <p>into your new directory</p><code>cd</code>
                <p>look at what’s inside using </p><code>ls -a</code>
                <p>initialize your git repo using</p><code>git init</code>
                <p>check the status of your repo by typing</p><code>git status</code>
                <p>This creates a new blank file.</p><code>touch README.md</code>
                <p>The output should make sense to you</p><code>git log</code>
